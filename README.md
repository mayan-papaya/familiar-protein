## [Regex Quest 2: Tears of the Ancients]

### Gamified, online tool for learning regex.

## What
  Progress tracking, gamified method for learning regular expressions online.

## Why
  Regular expression syntax is esoteric and tough to reason through. Learning
regular expressions generally means working them into existing projects on a trial and error
basis, or designing code to learn from.

  This approach mixes learning regex with other variables, like regex implementation in 
programming languages, and the logic of the code. 

  Resources such as coderbyte and Codeacademy allow users to learn programming without
worrying about unecessary complexities. This project aims to bring that ease of learning
to regular expressions. 

## How
  [Regex Quest 2: Tears of the Ancients] allows users to focus on learning regex through gamification. Users play through
an ever expanding set of levels to gain regex mastery, accruing points and ranks along the way.

## Words
  "[Regex Quest 2: Tears of the Ancients] gives users realistic regex use cases while tracking their progress, enabling
a greater learning while ignoring the complexities of modern software projects."
